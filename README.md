# upulsanjeewagamage.com - The Authority Theme
This repository contains the custom, high-performance WordPress theme for my personal authority platform, upulsanjeewagamage.com.

The "Architect's Dogfooding" Project
In line with my professional brand as an AI-Driven E-commerce Architect, I am building this platform from scratch as a live, public case study.

The philosophy is simple: build in public, prove the principles, and share the IP.

This theme is intentionally minimalist, secure, and built for speed. It serves as a real-world demonstration of how to leverage modern AI-assisted development to create high-quality digital assets efficiently.

Core Tech Stack
- Development: VS Code + GitHub Copilot
- Local Environment: LocalWP
- Platform: WordPress (Block Editor / Custom Blocks)
- Performance: Built from scratch to be lean. No heavy page builders.
